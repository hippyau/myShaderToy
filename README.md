Custom features:

- You CAN ADD CUSTOM UNIFORMS! and inputs for them will be added, not only that but if you do ```uniform vec3 color; //asColor``` that //asColor thing makes it so that you will have a color picker for that!
- You can both write normal shaders with a normal main function or shaders like in shader toy.
- You can load custom vertex shaders.
